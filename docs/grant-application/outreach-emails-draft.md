## 1. ACMI

**To:** [Find via acmi.net.au — look for programming/exhibitions contact, or use their general enquiries]
**Subject:** Australian indie game — Tech World — exploring exhibition/event fit

Hi,

I'm [Name] from Enspyrco, a Melbourne-based indie game studio. I'm writing to introduce our game Tech World and explore whether it might be a fit for ACMI's programming.

Tech World is a multiplayer game where writing real code is the core gameplay mechanic. Players explore a shared 2D world with 6 maps, solve 23 coding challenges across 3 difficulty tiers at terminal stations, and collaborate through proximity-based live video chat — all in the browser, no download required. An AI companion (powered by Claude) provides real-time tutoring and code review, with voice input and output support.

We have a working prototype at [URL] and are currently applying for Screen Australia's Games Production Fund, with a milestone of a playable public demo at PAX Aus in October 2026.

We'd love to understand whether Tech World might fit into ACMI's events, showcases, or interactive programming — either as a playable installation or as part of a games-focused event.

Happy to share a demo or chat further at your convenience.

Best regards,

## 2. Freeplay

**To:** [Find via freeplay.net.au — organisers/submissions contact]
**Subject:** Tech World — multiplayer coding game, interested in future Freeplay showcase

Hi,

I'm [Name] from Enspyrco, a Melbourne indie studio. I wanted to introduce Tech World and ask about submitting to a future Freeplay showcase.

Tech World is a multiplayer game where writing real Dart code is the core mechanic. Players explore 6 maps in a shared world, solve 23 coding challenges across 3 difficulty tiers at in-game terminals, collaborate via live video chat, design custom maps with a built-in editor, and get guidance from an AI tutor — all in the browser. It sits at an intersection no existing game occupies: Zachtronics-style coding puzzles meets social multiplayer meets AI companion.

We have a working prototype and are preparing a Screen Australia Games Production Fund application with a milestone of a PAX Aus demo in October 2026.

Could you point me to the right process for submitting to the Freeplay festival showcase? I'd also welcome any advice on timing — we're aiming to have a polished demo ready by late 2026.

Thanks for everything Freeplay does for the Australian indie scene.

Best,

## 3. State Library of Victoria

**To:** [Find via slv.vic.gov.au — digital programs/learning team, or general enquiries]
**Subject:** Multiplayer coding game — potential fit for SLV digital programs?

Hi,

I'm [Name] from Enspyrco, a Melbourne-based indie game studio. I'm reaching out because I think our game Tech World could be a natural fit for the State Library's digital learning and community programs.

Tech World is a browser-based multiplayer game where the gameplay is writing real code. Players explore 6 maps in a shared world, solve 23 coding challenges at in-game terminals, collaborate through live video chat, and talk to an AI companion using voice or text. It also includes a map editor and supports runtime map switching.

It's designed to make coding feel social and playful rather than academic — which is why I think it could work as a live group activity in your digital workshops or coding programs. It runs entirely in the browser, so there's nothing to install — it works on any computer with a modern browser and a webcam.

We're applying for Screen Australia funding and working toward a public demo at PAX Aus in October 2026. Would you be open to a brief conversation about whether Tech World might fit into your programming? I'd also be happy to run a pilot demo session with your team.

Best regards,

## 4. Powerhouse Museum (MAAS)

**To:** [Find via maas.museum — programs/exhibitions contact]
**Subject:** Tech World — interactive coding game, exploring exhibition fit

Hi,

I'm [Name] from Enspyrco, an Australian indie game studio. I'm writing to introduce Tech World, a multiplayer game at the intersection of gaming, coding, and AI, and to explore whether it might suit any of Powerhouse's interactive or technology-focused programming.

In Tech World, players explore 6 maps in a shared virtual world and solve 23 real coding challenges at in-game terminal stations. They collaborate through proximity-based live video chat, design custom maps with a built-in editor, and receive guidance from an AI tutor powered by Claude — via text or voice. It runs entirely in the browser — no installation required.

We're preparing a Screen Australia Games Production Fund application with a milestone of a playable demo at PAX Aus in October 2026.

If there are any upcoming exhibitions, events, or programs where an interactive coding game might be relevant, I'd welcome the chance to discuss further.

Best regards,

## Notes

- **Priority order:** Freeplay > State Library Vic > ACMI > Powerhouse
- Freeplay is the most natural fit and most likely to respond warmly
- SLV has the clearest practical use case (digital programs)
- ACMI is prestigious but a longer shot for a game that's still in development
- Powerhouse is exploratory — send it but don't stress if no response
- **Any response at all** — even "sounds interesting, get in touch when you have a demo" — is material for the grant application
- If anyone asks for a call, take it — a phone conversation you can reference is even stronger than an email exchange
